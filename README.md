# Ultimate-Guitar-Chord-Scraper
Python script for tech savvy guitarists that would rather interact with the terminal, python, and .txt files rather than ultimate-guitar.com. First you google your favorite song that you want to cover. Copy the link from the first ultimate-guitar.com link you see, and pop it into my script and magic (urllib2 and regular expressions) take care of the rest. The HTML gets cleaned into just the lyrics and chords (NO BULLSHIT LIKE ON ULTIMATE GUITAR) and printed to a ascii text file (could easily be modded to print into the terminal like during debug). Luckily they use a monospaced font on UG, so I recommend using your favorite monospaced text editor (*cough* sublime text *cough*).
